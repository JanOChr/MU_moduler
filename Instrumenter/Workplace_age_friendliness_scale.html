<b>Instructions:</b> The participants were asked to indicate on a seven-point Likert scale ranging from “strongly agree” to “absolutely disagree” the extent to which each of the statements is consistent with their organization’s values and conduct in addressing older workers. The participants were told that for the purpose of the study, an older worker is an employee aged 55 and older (in line with McCarthy et al., 2014).
